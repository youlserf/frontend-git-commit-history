# Git Commit History - Frontend

This is the readme for the "frontend" project. This project is a frontend application built using React, Vite, and other dependencies for development, linting, and building. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (at least version 16)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js installation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To run the project in development mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server provided by Vite and allow you to make changes to the code. The server will automatically reload your application as you save changes.

## Build

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will transpile your TypeScript code using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and then use Vite to bundle the application. The production-ready files will be placed in the "dist" directory.

## Linting

You can use ESLint to check your code for linting errors. To run the linter, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check your TypeScript and TypeScript React code for any linting issues. It's recommended to resolve all linting errors before building or deploying the project.

## Preview

If you want to preview the built application before deploying it, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to serve the production build of your application. You can access it in your web browser at the provided URL.

## Dependencies

Here are the main dependencies used in this project:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast build tool and development server.
